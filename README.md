Visualization is a powerful technology for interactive exploration of information. In this article, we present an interactive visualization system for exploring scientometric data in any field. Authors, their publications, co-authorships, citations and citation indices can be seen graphically and explored interactively to enable users to quickly visualize an area of research. Users can gauge the prominence, centrality and collaborations underlying the publications in the area of research. The system is designed to collect data incrementally as needed to answer user queries. The user interface is designed to first present an overview graphically, followed by details when demanded by the user while also facilitating navigation to other parts of the publication network. We believe that this is a significant step from the current state of the art wherein publication and citation data is presented as regular non-graphical search results.
